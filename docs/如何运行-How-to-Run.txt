# 如何运行

解压后可以看到 `launch.bat` 文件，如果没有显示扩展名，则会看到 `launch` 文件，格式为批处理文件。
双击 `launch.bat` 文件即可运行。如果 `launch.bat` 无法正常运行，你还可以尝试双击 `launch-with-pwsh.bat` 运行。
如果依然无法运行，那么你需要手动以管理员权限运行 `launch.bat` 文件。

# How to Run

After extracting, you will see a file named `launch.bat`.
If extension suffix is not shown, you would see a file named `app`, whose format is Windows Batch File.

Double-click the `launch.bat` file to run. If `launch.bat` does not work properly,
you may try double-clicking `launch-with-pwsh.bat` file.
If it still does not work, you would have to manually run `launch.bat` file with `Administrator` privilege.
